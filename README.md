Mission Description
We want you to calculate a sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.

Input
The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100).
Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
Output
For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.

Notes:
There should be no output until all the input has been received.
Do not put blank lines between test case solutions.
Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
Rules
Choose your favorite language from either of these two: Go, Python.

Do not use any for loop, while loop, or any list/set/dictionary comprehension.

Your solution will be tested against Python 3.12 (as of April 2024) or higher.

Code must include a main() function:

def main():
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
